NOTE:Here we are taken only vehicle sounds,suppose you have to take any horn sounds from different vehicles you have to download the mp3 files only for vehicle detection by horn.

## Problem Statement:

   Python code implementation using Machine Learning Algorithms for detection of vehicle by Sound.
   

## About the Project:

   The features of this project was to dectect Sound from different vehicles using some audio files which may already exist in our surroundings.

     I.Audio files(mp3 format)

     II.Essential libaries

     III.Train and Test Case in Project code
     

## Technical Implementation:

*Generally we know how the sounds are ringing on the Road.

*For that purpose we are decided to try to solve the problem using implementation of python with ML algorithms.

*Below is the flow chart for process.

## Techstacks used:

Pyhton, MachineLearning algorithms, Audio files(mp3).


## How to Run Locally:

*Clone the project.

*Take some vehicle sounds in MP3 format only, I have already provided via drive link in above download from that.

*Upload the Audio files(mp3) and code into google colab or jupyter notebook.

*Train the model with Audio files.

*Finally test the any one case from input cases(mp3).


## What Next?

This project is helpful to detect the vehicle sounds. In future many more vehicles will be drived on the road so the traffic will be happen so every rider starts thier horn, In this case we will detect the vehicle easily by horn detection.


## Declaration:

We confirm that the project showcased here was either developed entirely during the hackathon or underwent significant updates within the hackathon timeframe. We understand that if any plagiarism from online sources is detected, our project will be disqualified, and our participation in the hackathon will be revoked.
