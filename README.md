Problem Statement:

   Python code implementation using Machine Learning Algorithms for detection of vehicle horn.
   

About the Project:

   The features of this project was to dectect horn from different vehicles using some audio files which may already exist in our surroundings.

     I.Audio files(mp3 format)

     II.Essential libaries

     III.Train and Test Case in Project code
     

Technical Implementation:

*Generally we know how the horns are ringing on the Road.
*For that purpose we are decided to try to solve the problem using implementation of python with ML algorithms.
*Below is the flow chart for process.

Techstacks used:

Pyhton, MachineLearning algorithms, Audio files(mp3).


How to Run Locally:

*Clone the project.

*Take some horn sounds in MP3 format only.

*Upload the Audio files(mp3) into google colab or jupyter notebook.

*Train the model with Audio files.

*Finally test the any one case from input cases(mp3).


What Next?

This project is helpful to detect the horn sounds. In future many more vehicles will be drived on the road so the traffic will be happen so every rider starts thier horns, In this case we will detect the vehicle easily by horn detection.
